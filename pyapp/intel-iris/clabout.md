I'll create a comprehensive tutorial on parallel computing with Intel Iris Xe GPU using Python, with NLP as our case study!I've created a comprehensive pedagogical tutorial for GPU parallel computing with Intel Iris Xe! Here's what makes it special for learning:

## 🎓 **Pedagogical Structure**

**Progressive Learning Path:**
1. **Section 1**: CPU parallelism baseline (understand what we're improving)
2. **Section 2**: GPU architecture concepts (why GPUs are different)
3. **Section 3**: Simple GPU operations (hello world of GPU computing)
4. **Section 4**: Real NLP task - TF-IDF (practical application)
5. **Section 5**: Advanced semantic similarity (scaling up)
6. **Section 6**: Best practices (when and why)

## 🔑 **Key Learning Features**

- **Comparative approach**: Every example shows CPU vs GPU to understand the difference
- **Real NLP problems**: TF-IDF and semantic similarity are actual tasks you'd use
- **Clear metrics**: Timing and speedup calculations help you measure improvements
- **Conceptual explanations**: Each section explains the "why" before the "how"

## 🚀 **To Run This**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install dpctl dpnp numpy

# Optional: Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit for full GPU support
# Download from: software.intel.com/oneapi
```

## 💡 **Why NLP for Learning?**

NLP tasks are perfect for learning GPU programming because:
- **Intuitive**: Everyone understands text processing
- **Scalable**: Easy to see benefits with more data
- **Parallelizable**: Document operations are naturally independent
- **Practical**: Real-world applicable skills

The tutorial builds from simple vector operations to complex semantic similarity, showing how the same parallel principles scale!
